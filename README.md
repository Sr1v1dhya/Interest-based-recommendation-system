# Interest-Based Recommendation System

## Abstract
The Interest-Based Recommendation System aims to provide personalized content recommendations by leveraging user interests and social connections. This platform focuses on delivering relevant suggestions for movies, books, and TV shows, addressing the challenge of content overload through a targeted approach that enhances user engagement and satisfaction.

## Introduction
Traditional social networks often fail to provide customized recommendations, leaving users overwhelmed with irrelevant content. This project seeks to create a social platform that connects users with similar interests and recommends content based on their preferences and followersâ€™ activity.

## System Design
The system utilizes a structured SQL database with key entities such as:
- **USER**: Stores user details and preferences.
- **FOLLOW**: Represents user connections.
- **GENRE**: Captures user interest in different content genres.
- **MOVIES, BOOKS, and TVSHOWS**: Tables storing content details.

Users can follow others, select preferred genres and languages, and receive recommendations based on mutual interests and follower activity.

## Key Features
- **User Profiles**: Users personalize their profiles with genres and language preferences.
- **Recommendations**: A recommendation engine curates content based on user preferences and social connections.
- **Social Connectivity**: Users can follow others, view their preferences, and discover new content.
- **Content Tracking**: Previously consumed content is stored to avoid repetitive suggestions.

## Implementation
The system is developed using:
- **SQL**: Manages structured data and relationships.
- **Flask**: Provides backend services and API endpoints.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Enhances frontend styling and responsiveness.

The recommendation engine operates using SQL queries that filter content based on user-follow relationships and genre matches.

## Future Enhancements
Planned improvements include:
- Expanding content categories beyond movies, books, and TV shows.
- Enhancing the recommendation algorithm for improved accuracy.
- Implementing privacy controls for user preferences and recommendations.
